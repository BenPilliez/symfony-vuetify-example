# Symfony-Vuetify Example App

This is an example of using [Vuetify (v2.0.1)](https://vuetifyjs.com) in a [Symfony](https://symfony.com) app. I created this app by loosely following [this tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/create-single-page-application-symfony-vue-js-twilio-php).

CAVEAT: I am **not** a Symfony developer and so I can't say with confidence that the organization of the files in this project is a good one or would be correct for a bigger project. At a minimum, though, it does provide a minimal working example of using Vuetify in Symfony. I was able to get it running locally on a Mac (High Sierra). Good luck!
